<hr>
<h1 class="readable">Bio</h1>
<p class="readable">Formed in 2006, Black Veil Brides originally came together in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
    Primarily the brainchild of vocalist Andy Biersack (aka Andy Six), the band combines cathartic metalcore/screamo with a dark gothic image to set it apart from its contemporaries. 
    In their first couple of years together, Black Veil Brides went through a number of lineup changes while they gained attention from labels with two EPs, releasing Sex & Hollywood in 2007 and Never Give In in 2008. 
    The band eventually relocated to Los Angeles, settling on a lineup and beginning work on its full-length debut.</p>

<pre class="readable" > I was introduced to this band as a teen and I don't know where I would be without them.
 A lot of thier lyric content back then was about believing in yourself and surviving despite
 the "establishment" or 'social norms' that stood in your way. I still enjoy singing along to
 the songs and sometimes I even listen while I code. It helps me focus and instills confidence!
